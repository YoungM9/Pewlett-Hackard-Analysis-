# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis-

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis was to determine employees retirement eligibility based on their titles for certain departments. This was done in hopes to realize how talent is to be replaced in the business as to avoid major losses. Cleaning and filtering of the data wasnecessary to obtain the final list. 

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

- software engineers and senoir staff  comprised the highest list of individuals who are retiring out of all departments whilst managers were the least, with only two leaving 
- only 1550 people qualified for the mentorship program which are also those who still are still employed at the company 
- The number of those retiring far exceeds the number those that qualify for the program
- Senior Staff and Engineers are amongst the pool of mentorship titles that have the most eligible individuals 

Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

There are currently  72458 retiring employees. However this doesnt mean that every single position need to be filled in order for them to begin to have an impact. Retitring employees technincally havent retired yet so they can still fulfill their roles until at least half of the worksforce in each department is retiring and the upcoming mentees. This can occur in waves depending on when exactly people plan to reitre, so that those who are leaving earlier can train their cohort and leave the rest ot their mentees whilst the later retirees can train theirs after, leaving no gaps in work efficiency. 

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are more than enough retirement ready employees eligible to eduacte the next wave of eligible employees. There are almost 10 times more eligible mentees than there are mentors allowing an easy distribution of mentees to get individualized attention.
